 ### CHALLENGE TO TEST UNDERSTANDING OF THEORY CLASSES:

      Create a new Class for a bank account
      Create fields for the account number, balance, customer name, email and phone number.

      Create getters and setters for each field
      Create 2 additional methods
           1. To allow the customer to deposit funds (this should increment the balance field)
           2. To allow the customer to withdraw funds. (this should deduct from the balance field)
               but do not allow the withdrawal to complete if there are insufficient funds.
      You will want to create various code in the Main Class to confirm your code is working
      Add some System.out.println's in the methods above as well.
